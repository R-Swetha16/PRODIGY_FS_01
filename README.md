Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed Task 1 as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech! ðŸš€
This task involved implementing a User Authentication System, where:
Frontend: Built with React.js
Backend: Powered by Node.js
Database: Managed with MongoDB
This project was a great opportunity to enhance my full-stack development skills and deepen my understanding of secure authentication workflows.
Looking forward to tackling the next challenge and growing further in this journey! ðŸ’»âœ¨
